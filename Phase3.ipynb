        "In this project, we apply two essential data mining techniques: classification and clustering, to predict and better understand breast cancer diagnosis.\n",
        "For classification, we train a Decision Tree model using features extracted from digitized images of fine-needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses. These features — such as mean radius, texture, smoothness, compactness, and symmetry — describe the characteristics of cell nuclei.\n",
        "The goal is to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign, making this a binary classification problem. The Decision Tree approach is used to learn interpretable rules that can support medical diagnosis and decision-making.\n",
        "For clustering, we apply the K-Means algorithm to group samples with similar feature patterns without using the diagnosis label. This unsupervised analysis helps uncover hidden structures in the data, identify potential subgroups of tumors, and provide insights into the underlying relationships among the measured features.\n",
        "Together, these two techniques offer both predictive power and exploratory understanding, supporting early detection and deeper insight into breast cancer characteristics."
